<BR>I don't want a lot for Christmas</BR>
There's just one thing I need</BR>
I don't care about presents</BR>
Underneath the Christmas tree</BR>
I just want you for my own</BR>
More than you could ever know</BR>
Make my wish come true</BR>
All I want for Christmas is you.</BR>

<BR>
<BR>I don't want a lot for Christmas</BR>
There is just one thing I need</BR>
I don't care about presents</BR>
Underneath the Christmas tree</BR>
I don't need to hang my stocking</BR>
There upon the fireplace</BR>
Santa Claus won't make me happy</BR>
With a toy on Christmas day</BR>
I just want you for my own</BR>
More than you could ever know</BR>
Make my wish come true</BR>
All I want for Christmas is you</BR>
You baby</BR>
<BR>
<BR>I won't ask for much this Christmas</BR>
I won't even wish for snow</BR>
I'm just gonna keep on waiting</BR>
Underneath the mistletoe</BR>
I won't make a list and send it</BR>
To the North Pole for Saint Nick</BR>
I won't even stay awake to</BR>
Hear those magic reindeer click</BR>
'Cause I just want you here tonight</BR>
Holding on to me so tight</BR>
What more can I do</BR>
Baby all I want for Christmas is you</BR>
You</BR>
<BR>
<BR>All the lights are shining</BR>
So brightly everywhere</BR>
And the sound of children's</BR>
Laughter fills the air</BR>
And everyone is singing</BR>
I hear those sleigh bells ringing</BR>
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need</BR>
Won't you please bring my baby to me</BR>
<BR>
<BR>Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas</BR>
This is all I'm asking for</BR>
I just want to see my baby</BR>
Standing right outside my door</BR>
Oh I just want him for my own</BR>
More than you could ever know</BR>
Make my wish come true</BR>
Baby all I want for Christmas is</BR>
You</BR>
<BR>
<BR>All I want for Christmas is you baby</BR>
All I want for Christmas is you bab</BR>
